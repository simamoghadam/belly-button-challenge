Goal:
The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes bacterial data using D3.js and Plotly. It allows users to explore sample metadata and view bacterial cultures through bubble and bar charts.


Bar Chart

The Bar Chart displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) found in the selected sample.

x-axis: Number of bacteria (sample values).

y-axis: OTU IDs (labelled as OTU ID).

Bars: Represent the count of each bacterial species, ordered by frequency, with the most abundant species at the top.

Purpose:

To identify which bacterial species are most prevalent in the sample.

Bubble Chart

The Bubble Chart visualises the relationship between bacterial species and their abundance in the selected sample.

x-axis: OTU IDs 

y-axis: Number of bacteria

Bubbles: Represent individual OTUs. The size of each bubble corresponds to the abundance of that OTU, and the color represents different OTU IDs.

Purpose:

To provide a detailed view of the distribution and abundance of different bacterial species in the sample. It helps in understanding the relative abundance of each OTU.

Deployment:

deploying the dashboard makes it accessible online, allowing users to interact with the visualizations and data through a web browser.
